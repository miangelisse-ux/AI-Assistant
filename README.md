## Production Use

This project was developed as part of a university UX course to demonstrate applied UX methodology. It serves as a structured design blueprint for a functional product and showcases workflow modeling, interface design, and usability best practices.

## Problem

Users often encounter friction when navigating complex systems due to:

- Poor information hierarchy  
- Confusing navigation paths  
- Overloaded interfaces  
- Lack of system feedback  
- Inconsistent interaction patterns  

This project aims to design a streamlined experience that improves clarity, efficiency, and overall usability.

## Usage

- Open the prototype link.
- Navigate through the dashboard and task flow.
- Interact with forms and interface elements.
- Observe validation feedback and confirmation messaging.

## Tech Stack

- Axure RP (Interactive Prototyping)
- UX Research & Workflow Modeling
- Information Architecture Planning
- Wireframing & High-Fidelity Design

## Core Features

- Structured dashboard layout  
- Guided task workflow  
- Clear call-to-action hierarchy  
- Status indicators and validation feedback  
- Confirmation and completion screens  

## System Logic Overview

1. User lands on the primary dashboard.
2. User selects a primary task or workflow.
3. System guides the user through structured steps.
4. Inputs are validated before progression.
5. User receives confirmation and next-step guidance.

## Engineering Considerations

If implemented as a full application, considerations would include:

- Responsive UI architecture  
- Component-based design system  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Role-based permissions (if applicable)  
- API-driven data management  
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG standards)

## Future Improvements

- Conduct formal user testing sessions  
- Perform accessibility audits  
- Refine mobile-first responsiveness  
- Integrate backend functionality  
- Add analytics tracking for user behavior  

## Setup

This repository contains design documentation and references to the interactive prototype.

To view the prototype:

1. Open the live Axure link provided above.
2. Navigate through the interface to explore the workflow.

## How to Run

No local installation is required.

The prototype is hosted online and can be accessed through the live link.

If developed into a production application, setup instructions would include:

- Cloning the repository
- Installing dependencies
- Running the development server
