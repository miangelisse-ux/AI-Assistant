## Production Use

This project was developed as part of a university UX course to demonstrate applied design thinking and AI-assisted system interaction. It serves as a conceptual blueprint for an AI-powered assistant that helps students efficiently navigate academic services, deadlines, and campus resources.

## Problem

Students often struggle to navigate large university systems due to:

- Fragmented information across multiple portals  
- Unclear academic processes  
- Difficulty locating relevant forms and deadlines  
- Limited real-time guidance  
- Overwhelming institutional interfaces  

This results in confusion, missed deadlines, and increased administrative burden.

## Usage

- Open the prototype link.
- Interact with the AI assistant interface.
- Enter sample student-related questions or select suggested prompts.
- Follow guided responses and workflow navigation.
- Observe confirmation messages and next-step recommendations.

## Tech Stack

- Axure RP (Interactive Prototyping)
- UX Research & Workflow Modeling
- Conversational Interface Design
- Information Architecture Planning
- Wireframing & High-Fidelity Interface Design

## Core Features

- AI chat-style assistant interface  
- Guided academic workflow support  
- Quick access to key university services  
- Context-aware suggestions  
- Clear confirmation and next-step guidance  
- Structured dashboard layout  

## System Logic Overview

1. Student accesses the AI assistant dashboard.
2. Student enters a question or selects a suggested action.
3. System interprets intent and provides guided responses.
4. Assistant directs student to relevant resources or workflows.
5. Student receives confirmation and next-step recommendations.

## Engineering Considerations

If implemented as a production system, considerations would include:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) integration  
- Secure authentication (FIU SSO integration)  
- Role-based personalization (undergraduate, graduate, faculty)  
- API integration with university systems  
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG standards)  
- Scalable cloud-based architecture  

## Future Improvements

- Integration with live FIU academic databases  
- Personalized academic tracking dashboard  
- Mobile-first optimization  
- Predictive reminders for deadlines  
- Expanded AI conversational capabilities  
- Analytics for usage insights and optimization  

## Setup

This repository contains design documentation and a link to the interactive prototype.

To explore the AI assistant prototype:

1. Open the live Axure link provided above.
2. Navigate through the dashboard and conversational interface.
3. Interact with guided workflows and suggestions.

## How to Run

No installation is required.

The prototype is hosted online and can be accessed directly via the live link.

If developed into a functional AI application, setup instructions would include:

- Cloning the repository
- Installing frontend and backend dependencies
- Configuring API credentials
- Running the development server
